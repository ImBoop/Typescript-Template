# Typescript template
If you're working on a new Typescript project, this might help you out.

Just download the zip from GitHub, extract to wherever,
run `npm install`, then you should be good to go.


# What this is
I got tired of doing the same thing several times, so I made a template.
It sets you up with a (decently) clean TypeScript environment with support for debugging in VS Code,
adds a script for `npm start`, and for adding custom JSON schemas if you go that route.
